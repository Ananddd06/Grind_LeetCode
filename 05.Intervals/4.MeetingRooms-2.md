# Meeting Rooms II

## Problem Statement

Given an array of **meeting time intervals** `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`,  
return the **minimum number of conference rooms required** to schedule all meetings.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output = 1
**Explanation:**  
Since there is **no overlap**, only **one room** is required.

---

## Constraints:

- `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^6`

- PYTHON

```python
from collections import deque

def minMeetingRooms(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return 0

    # Sort intervals by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    dq = deque()  # Deque to store meeting end times
    min_rooms = 0

    for start, end in intervals:
        # Remove meetings that have ended
        while dq and dq[0] <= start:
            dq.popleft()

        # Add the current meeting end time
        dq.append(end)

        # Track the max rooms required
        min_rooms = max(min_rooms, len(dq))

    return min_rooms

```
