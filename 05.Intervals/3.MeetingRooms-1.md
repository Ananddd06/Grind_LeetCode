# Meeting Rooms

## Problem Statement

Given an array of **meeting time intervals** `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, determine if a person can **attend all meetings**.

A person can attend all meetings **only if none of the intervals overlap**.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output = false

**Explanation:**  
The person cannot attend all meetings because:

- Meeting `[0,30]` overlaps with `[5,10]` and `[15,20]`.

---

## Example 2:

**Input:**
intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output = true

**Explanation:**  
The person can attend both meetings since there are no overlapping intervals.

---

## Constraints:

- `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^6`

- PYTHON

```python
from collections import deque

def canAttendMeetings(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return True

    # Sort intervals by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    dq = deque()  # Deque to track meeting end times

    for start, end in intervals:
        if dq and start < dq[-1]:  # Check if current start overlaps with the last end
            return False
        dq.append(end)  # Add the meeting end time

    return True
```
