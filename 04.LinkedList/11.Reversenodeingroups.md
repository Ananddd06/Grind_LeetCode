# Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups

You are given the head of a linked list.

The nodes in the linked list are sequentially assigned to non-empty groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...). The length of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words:

- The 1st node is assigned to the first group.
- The 2nd and the 3rd nodes are assigned to the second group.
- The 4th, 5th, and 6th nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.
- Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to 1 + the length of the second-to-last group.

You need to reverse the nodes in each group with an even length and return the head of the modified linked list.

## Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
head = [5, 2, 6, 3, 9, 1, 7, 3, 8, 4]
Output = [5, 6, 2, 3, 9, 1, 4, 8, 3, 7]

Explanation:

* The length of the first group is 1, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
* The length of the second group is 2, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.
* The length of the third group is 3, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
* The length of the last group is 4, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.

```

## Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
head = [1, 1, 0, 6]
Output = [1, 0, 1, 6]

Explanation:

* The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
* The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
* The length of the last group is 1. No reversal occurs.

    def reverseEvenLengthGroups(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        res = []
        curr = head
        while curr:
            res.append(curr.val)
            curr = curr.next

        n = len(res)
        i , group_size = 0 , 1
        while i < n:
            end = min(i + group_size , n)
            if (end - i) % 2 == 0:
                res[i:end] = res[i:end][::-1]
            i = end
            group_size += 1

        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy
        for val in res:
            curr.next = ListNode(val)
            curr = curr.next

        return dummy.next
```
