# Reverse Linked List Between Given Positions

Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the reversed list.

## Problem Description

You are given a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right`. The task is to reverse the part of the list starting at position `left` and ending at position `right`. You need to return the linked list after the reversal.

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], left = 2, right = 4
output = [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
output = [5]

```

- PYTHON

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        res = []
        curr = head
        while curr:
            res.append(curr.val)
            curr = curr.next

        res[left-1:right] = res[left-1:right][::-1]

        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy
        for val in res:
            curr.next = ListNode(val)
            curr = curr.next

        return dummy.next
```
