# Remove Nodes with Greater Value on Right

## Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list.

Remove every node that has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.

Return the head of the modified linked list.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
head = [5,2,13,3,8]
Output = [13,8]

**Explanation:**  
The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2, and 3.

- Node 13 is to the right of node 5.
- Node 13 is to the right of node 2.
- Node 8 is to the right of node 3.

---

## Example 2:

**Input:**  
head = [1,1,1,1]
output = [1,1,1,1]
**Explanation:**  
Every node has value `1`, so no nodes are removed.

---

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the given list is in the range **[1, 10⁵]**.
- **1 ≤ Node.val ≤ 10⁵**

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        res = []
        curr = head
        while curr:
            res.append(curr.val)
            curr = curr.next

        n = len(res)
        stack = []
        max = float('-inf')
        for i in range(n - 1 , -1 , -1):
            if res[i] >= max:
                stack.append(res[i])
                max = res[i]

        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy
        while stack:
            curr.next = ListNode(stack.pop())
            curr = curr.next

        return dummy.next
```
