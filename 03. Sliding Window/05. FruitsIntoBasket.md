# Fruit Picker Problem

## Problem Description

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits`, where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the `i-th` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible, but there are some strict rules that you must follow:

- You only have **two baskets**, and each basket can only hold a **single type of fruit**.
- There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree) while moving to the right.
- The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.

### Your Task

Given the integer array `fruits`, return the **maximum number of fruits** you can pick.

## Examples

Example 1:

```
fruits = [1, 2, 1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
```

Example 2:

```
fruits = [0, 1, 2, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can pick from trees [1, 2, 2].
If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0, 1].
```

- JAVA

```java
class Solution {
    public int totalFruit(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0){
            return - 1;
        }
        HashMap<Integer , Integer> hash = new HashMap<>();
        int left = 0;
        int maxlen = 0;
        for(int right = 0 ; right < nums.length ; right++){
            int window = nums[right];
            hash.put(window , hash.getOrDefault(window , 0)+1);

            while(hash.size() > 2){
                int leftchar = nums[left];
                hash.put(leftchar , hash.get(leftchar)-1);

                if(hash.get(leftchar)==0){
                    hash.remove(leftchar);
                }
                left++;
            }
            maxlen = Math.max(maxlen , right - left + 1);
        }
        return maxlen ;
    }
}
```

- PYTHON

```python
class Solution:
    def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
        hash_map = {}
        left = 0
        maxlen = 0
        for right in range(len(fruits)):
            hash_map[fruits[right]] = hash_map.get(fruits[right] , 0) + 1

            while len(hash_map) > 2:
                hash_map[fruits[left]] -= 1

                if hash_map[fruits[left]] == 0:
                    del hash_map[fruits[left]]

                left += 1

            maxlen = max(maxlen , right - left + 1)

        return maxlen
```
