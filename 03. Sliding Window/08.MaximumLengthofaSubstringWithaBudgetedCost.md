# Maximum Length of a Substring With a Budgeted Cost

## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `maxCost`.

You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i`th character of `s` to the `i`th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t` with a cost **less than or equal to** `maxCost`. If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output : 3
Explanation:
We can change "abc" of s to "bcd", which costs 3.
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output : 1
Explanation:
Each character in s costs 2 to change to the corresponding character in t,
so the maximum length is 1.
```

- JAVA

```java
class Solution {
    public int equalSubstring(String s, String t, int maxCost) {
        int n = s.length();
        int left = 0, currentCost = 0, maxLength = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            // Compute cost to change s[right] to t[right]
            currentCost += Math.abs(s.charAt(right) - t.charAt(right));

            // If cost exceeds maxCost, shrink window from left
            while (currentCost > maxCost) {
                currentCost -= Math.abs(s.charAt(left) - t.charAt(left));
                left++; // Move left pointer to reduce cost
            }

            // Update maximum length
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}

```

```python
class Solution:
    def equalSubstring(self, s: str, t: str, maxCost: int) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        left = 0
        current_cost = 0
        maxlen = 0
        for right in range(n):
            current_cost += abs(ord(s[right]) - ord(t[left]))

            while current_cost > maxCost:
                current_cost -= abs(ord(s[left]) - ord(t[left]))
                left += 1

            maxlen = max(maxlen , right - left + 1)

        return maxlen
```
