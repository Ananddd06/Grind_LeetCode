# Sliding Window Maximum

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. There is a sliding window of size `k` which moves from the very left of the array to the very right.  
You can only see the `k` numbers in the window at a time. Each time the sliding window moves **right by one position**.

Return the **maximum values** in the sliding window.

## Example 1

### **Input**

```plaintext
nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output = [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation :
Window Position	Max
[1, 3, -1] -3 5 3 6 7 =	3
1 [3, -1, -3] 5 3 6 7 =	3
1 3 [-1, -3, 5] 3 6 7 =	5
1 3 -1 [-3, 5, 3] 6 7 =	5
1 3 -1 -3 [5, 3, 6] 7 =	6
1 3 -1 -3 5 [3, 6, 7] =	7

```
